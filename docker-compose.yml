    # On Apple Silicon (arm64) Docker may pull an amd64 image which triggers
    # the platform mismatch warning and requires emulation. Setting platform
    # forces the image architecture; this may be slower because it uses qemu.
    # Alternatively you can replace phpMyAdmin with an ARM-native admin UI
    # such as `adminer` if you prefer native performance.
